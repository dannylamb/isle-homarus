## MVP 2 sprint

* **TO DO:** Build a local image without docker-compose: _pseudo-code do not run this yet_
  * `docker build -t islandoradevops/isle-homarus .`

* **TO DO:** Despite successful build, further testing is required to determine if the resulting container works, what happens and how to communicate with it.

* **TO DO:** How to expose API-X endpoints for Homarus e.g. `/homarus/convert` to be called by curl or is this an Apache setup change on the Drupal site or both the service and site?

* **TO DO:** Add SYN / JWT

* **TO DO:** Convert Apache logging to stdout / stderr
